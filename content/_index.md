Hi! I'm currently a Research Fellow in Statistics at Monash University working in collaboration with Lauren Kennedy, Qixuan Chen and Andrew Gelman in Columbia University. I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Australian National University under the supervision of Grace Chiu and Anton Westveld.

 My general training have been in Bayesian inference and methods in applications to the social science. My methodological training include multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) method, Bayesian hierarchical (or multilevel/mixed) modelling, spatial models, causal inference while writing and coding up my own MCMC sampling methods. Currently as part of the postdoc, we're working on extending and exploring the use of [MRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_regression_with_poststratification). While in my [PhD thesis](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/264129),Â  we created a holistic socio-economic index while accounting for uncertainty estimation (we called it _LACSH_) for countries. 
 
 This is where I store all my personal notes (for private viewing only) and some other stuff that are useful for myself and (possibly) useful for public dissemination of knowledge.
