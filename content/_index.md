Hi! I'm **Swen Kuh** _(last name pronounced as k-oo-h)_. My first name actually has two words and I've also published under **F. Swen Kuh**. 

I'm currently a **Research Fellow in Statistics** at the University of Adelaide (contract transfer from Monash University due to the relocation of my supervisor). I am now working remotely in Melbourne with [Dr. Lauren Kennedy](https://jazzystats.com/about.html) (University of Adelaide), in collaboration with [Assoc. Prof. Qixuan Chen](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/qixuan-chen-phd) and [Prof. Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/)  (Columbia University). I am also concurrently a **Teaching Associate** at Monash University, co-lecturing Data Visualization and Analytics to both undergraduates and Masters students.

I was an [IBISWorld PhD scholar](https://www.anu.edu.au/giving/impact-stories/nurturing-new-ideas) and obtained my PhD in Statistics from Australian National University under the supervision of [Prof. Grace Chiu](https://www.vims.edu/people/chiu_gs/) (now at William \& Mary) and [Dr. Anton Westveld](https://westveld-statsci.com/). Previously, I had a minor in sociology and graduated from Honours in Statistics from University of Auckland (home of the R software!) working under [COMPASS](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/arts/our-research/research-institutes-centres-groups/compass.html), a quantitative social science research institute.

# Research

Research interests:
- Bayesian inference and methods 
- Social science applications
- Data visualisation

My general training have been in **Bayesian inference and methods in applications to the social sciences**. My methodological training include multilevel regression and poststratification ([MRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_regression_with_poststratification)) method, Bayesian hierarchical (or multilevel/mixed) modelling, spatial modelling and causal inference using countries' socio-economic data while writing and coding up our own MCMC sampling methods. I also enjoy extracting insights from data and different ways of visualising the data and results. 
 

#### Here are some of my documented work:
