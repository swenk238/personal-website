Hi! I'm **Swen Kuh** _(last name pronounced as k-oo-h)_. My first name actually has two words and I've also published under **F. Swen Kuh**. I have an unconventional background in Statistics and Sociology and interested in the intuitive intepretations of Bayesian outputs and all things sociologically-related.

I'm currently a **Senior Research Officer** with the _Ten to Men_ team at the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS). I am also concurrently a Research Associate at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University working with [Dr. Anna Zhu](https://annazhu.site) under an [ARC Linkage Grant](https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/LP230100121) investigating “The Intended and Unintended Impact of Policy for Adaptive Policy Management”.

In a previous life I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Statistics at the University of Adelaide (previously Monash University with the same collaborators) with [Dr. Lauren Kennedy](https://jazzystats.com/about.html) (University of Adelaide), in collaboration with [Assoc. Prof. Qixuan Chen](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/qixuan-chen-phd) and [Prof. Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/)  (Columbia University). I also lectured at Monash University, teaching Data Visualisation and Analytics to both undergraduates and Masters students at the Monash Business School and introduced the Data Analytics Fundamental module in the Faculty of Arts.

My PhD in Statistics was obtained from the Australian National University under the supervision of [Prof. Grace Chiu](https://www.vims.edu/people/chiu_gs/) (now at William \& Mary) and [Dr. Anton Westveld](https://westveld-statsci.com/) as an [IBISWorld PhD scholar](https://www.anu.edu.au/giving/impact-stories/nurturing-new-ideas). In Aoteoroa New Zealand, I graduated with Honours in Statistics from University of Auckland (home of the R software!) working under [COMPASS](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/arts/our-research/research-institutes-centres-groups/compass.html), a quantitative social science research institute and worked as a consultant, conducting qualitative interviews in market research companies.


# Research

Research interests:
- Bayesian inference and methods 
- Social science applications
- Data visualisations

My general training have been in **Bayesian inference and methods in applications to the social sciences**. My methodological training include multilevel regression and poststratification ([MRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_regression_with_poststratification)) method, Bayesian hierarchical (or multilevel/mixed) modelling, spatial modelling and causal inference using countries' socio-economic data while writing and coding up our own MCMC sampling methods. I also enjoy extracting insights from data and different ways of visualising the data and results.
