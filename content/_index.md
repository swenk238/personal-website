Hi! I'm Swen Kuh. 

I'm currently a **Research Fellow in Statistics at Monash University** working in collaboration with **Lauren Kennedy** (soon starting in University of Adelaide), **Qixuan Chen** and **Andrew Gelman** in Columbia University. 

I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Australian National University under the supervision of **Grace Chiu** and **Anton Westveld**. I had a minor in sociology and graduated from Honours in Statistics from University of Auckland (home of ![/images/Rlogo.jpg] R!) working under [COMPASS](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/arts/our-research/research-institutes-centres-groups/compass.html) the quantitative social science research institute.

# Research
My general training have been in **Bayesian inference and methods in applications to the social science**. My methodological training include multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) method, Bayesian hierarchical (or multilevel/mixed) modelling, spatial models, causal inference while writing and coding up my own MCMC sampling methods. 
 
 Here are some of my documented work:

- [“Using leave‑one‑out cross validation (LOO) in a multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) workflow: A cautionary tale”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01773) - joint work with Lauren Kennedy, Qixuan Chen, Andrew Gelman (in review). 

- [“Latent Causal Socioeconomic Health Index."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12217) - joint work with Grace Chiu and Anton Westveld 

- [“Modeling National Latent Socioeconomic Health and Examination of Policy Effects via Causal Inference.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00512) - joint work with Grace Chiu and Anton Westveld (preprint).
