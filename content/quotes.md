Some of my favourite quotes about stats:

> “The quiet statisticians have changed our world; not by discovering new facts or technical developments, but by changing the ways that we reason, experiment and form our opinions.”
> 
> Ian Hacking

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.
> 
> George Box, statistician

> "The best way to improve a theory is to study _anomalies"_
> 
> Clayton Christensen, HBS Professor

> If experiment is the queen of sciences, then statistics is the Guardian of royal virtue.
> 
> Nyron Tribus

> “The best thing about being a _statistician_ is that you get to play in everyone's _backyard_.”
> 
> — **John Tukey**

> Even while living in a world of uncertainty, we make assumptions and, from there, try to do things that are optimal (or nearly so) within our assumptions.
> 
> Andrew Gelman
