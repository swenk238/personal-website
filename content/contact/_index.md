 Currently as part of the postdoc, we're working on extending and exploring the use of MRP. While in my [PhD thesis](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/264129), we created a holistic socio-economic index while accounting for uncertainty estimation (we called it _LACSH_ index) for countries. 

This is where I store all my personal notes (for private viewing only) and some other stuff that are useful for myself and (maybeee) useful for public dissemination of knowledge.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swenkuh) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swenkuh/) if you've any questions or queries.
