 My general training have been in **Bayesian inference and methods in applications to the social science**. My methodological training include multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) method, Bayesian hierarchical (or multilevel/mixed) modelling, spatial models, causal inference while writing and coding up my own MCMC sampling methods. 
 
 Here are some of the work and data I've worked on: 

- [“Using leave‑one‑out cross validation (LOO) in a multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) workflow: A cautionary tale”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01773) 
  
    - Kuh, S., Kennedy, L., Chen Q, Gelman A. (in review). 
- [“Latent Causal Socioeconomic Health Index."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12217) 
  
    - Kuh, F.S., Chiu, G.S., Westveld, A.H. (preprint). 
- [“Modeling National Latent Socioeconomic Health and Examination of Policy Effects via Causal Inference.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00512)
    
    - Kuh, F.S., Chiu, G.S., Westveld, A.H. (preprint).
